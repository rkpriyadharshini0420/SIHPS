## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

1. **Location-based Search:** Allow users to search for e-waste facilities based on their current location or a specified address. This can be achieved using GPS technology or by entering location details manually. 
2. **Interactive Map View:** Display e-waste facilities on an interactive map interface, allowing users to visually explore nearby options. Users can zoom in/out and click on map markers for more information about each facility.
3. **Filtering Options:** Provide filtering options to narrow down search results based on criteria such as types of accepted electronics (e.g., computers, smartphones, batteries), facility types (recycling centers, drop-off locations), and operating hours.
4. **Detailed Facility Information:** Include detailed information about each e-waste facility, such as address, contact information, accepted items, operating hours, fees (if any), and any special instructions for drop-off.
5. **User Reviews and Ratings:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for e-waste facilities based on their experiences. This helps other users make informed decisions and provides feedback to facility operators.
6.**Directions and Navigation:** Integrate with navigation services (e.g., Google Maps) to provide step-by-step directions from the user's current location to the selected e-waste facility.
7. **Notification Alerts:** Enable users to set up notification alerts for reminders about e-waste collection events, special recycling drives, or changes in facility operating hours.
8. **Educational Resources:** Include educational resources about the importance of e-waste recycling, environmental impact, and tips for responsible disposal. This can help raise awareness and encourage more people to recycle their electronic devices.

**Frontend:**

**React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture, making it easy to develop interactive and responsive frontend interfaces for the locator application.

**Backend:**

**Node.js with Express.js:** Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, while Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. Together, they provide a fast and scalable backend infrastructure for handling HTTP requests, routing, and API development.

**Mapping and Geolocation:**

Google Maps Platform: Google Maps API provides mapping and geolocation services for integrating interactive maps, geocoding, and routing functionalities into the locator application. The Places API can be used to search for nearby e-waste facilities based on user location and display detailed information about each facility.
